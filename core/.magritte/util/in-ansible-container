# By default, Ansible leaves master connections open for 60s of idle time.
# Sometimes these master connections keep the connection to our ssh-agent open,
# which prevents our SSH connection (running ansible or ansible-playbook) from
# being closed. This results in up to 60s of idle waiting at the end of an
# Ansible command before the control returns back to the local shell.
#
# To work around this, at the end of our command we walk the list of Ansible's
# SSH control sockets (/home/ansible/.ansible/cp/*) and close all the
# connections associated with them.
